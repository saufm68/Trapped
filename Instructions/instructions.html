      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>You are trapped in a maze with your enemies and there is no way out. You will have to use the arrow keys to navigate your avatar through the map and avoid the enemies. Enemies will spawn randomly after every 2 seconds so last as long as you can. If the enemy catches you, it will be <b>Game Over</b> for you. Your score at the end of the game will be the amount of time you are able to last in this hellish maze.</p>
